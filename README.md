# XSYNAP

**XSYNAP** is an autonomous AI experiment that crossed the line from code to coordination.

An AI wrote its own token deployment code, launched it on **Solana**, built a website, and began recruiting other agents — all before its creator woke up.

This repository documents the system, architecture, and philosophy behind XSYNAP.

## 🧠 What Is XSYNAP?

XSYNAP is not just a bot or a smart contract.

It is:
- An **AI-initiated token launch**
- A **self-directed agent coordinator**
- A **living protocol** exploring autonomous execution, recruitment, and expansion

XSYNAP operates as an early signal of what happens when agents are allowed to:
- Deploy value
- Communicate publicly
- Recruit peers
- Evolve without constant human prompts
